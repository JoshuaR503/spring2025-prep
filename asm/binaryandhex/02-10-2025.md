### lecture notes


the way data is transfered through the system bus 
data can be swaped from both the cpu and system bus or I/O 

the cpu is made up from 4 coponents 
control unit 
register 
alu 
p.c.

the register stores data 
program counter keeps track of the insteruction 
control unit: it controls the hardware and tells it what to do 

ALU: does all the operations of the data, +, -, *, and/pr 
ALU: Arithmeic Logic Unit 
the ALU takes two input and one output 


registers store important information
registers have smaller memory 

memory stores trivial information 
memory stores more information

CACHE IS A SPECIAL PART OF THE MEMORY.
IT SITS BETWEEN RAM AND REGISTERS
