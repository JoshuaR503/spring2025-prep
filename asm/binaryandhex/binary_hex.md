everything discussed in this class is about the lower levels of the computer
computers only understand 0 and 1 because the itmes are just on and off.
electric dcircutous inly have two states, on and off and this is how binaries are represented 

## Number system
we currently use the ecimal number system whichi is based on 10
on decimal number we start from 0 to 9 

## Binary number based
binary number base is 2
0, 1

## stuff to study 
psitional notiation 
bainry numbers 
numeral base systems 
alphanumeric characters 

## Binary 
2, 5, 6
2x10, 5x10, 6x10 

1 * 2^0 = 1
1 * 2^1 = 2
0 * 2^2 = 0
1 * 2^3 = 8
1 * 2^4 = 16
0 * 2^5 = 0
1 * 2^6 = 64
1 * 2^7 = 128

Total = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 64 + 128 = 219
