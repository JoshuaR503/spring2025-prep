## cheat sheet

- remember something about accessing static fields in sub classes
fields ans static methods follow the reference type 
instance emthods follow the object type

rules of type compatibly and type casting 
obecjt class genetic 
polymorphism rules on methid access 


abstract class methods and encapsulation 

## abstrac lasses
an abstrract class is a base class
you are not supposed to insiantialte abstract classes
abstract classes are ideas that must be implemented 
methods in abstract classes must be abstract

## interfaces
interfaces are similar to abstract classes 
cannot instantiate an interface 

an interface is a set of rules 

## encapsulation 
you do not need to worry about any imoplementation details, you only get to use them
