## Market Validation and Growth Strategy

### Market Validation
- Ensure you have proven the market.
- Determine how to capture a small segment of the market.

### Acquisition and Growth
- As you bring in more users, growth should be continuous and upward.
- Ensure user numbers are increasing.
- Provide long-term value to users.
- Ensure the product retains users.
- Maintain continuous growth by attracting more customers.
    - **Flywheel Effect**: Growth should be self-sustaining.

### Value Proposition
- Ensure a strong value proposition.
    - This can be a product or service.

### Key Considerations
- How to attract new users and customers.
- Define what constitutes an acquired user.
- Identify metrics that show user satisfaction.
    - Be honest about these metrics.
    - Examples: hours spent, ads watched, awareness.
- Define actionable steps.
- Ensure there is a network effect.
    - 1:1 sales are the most difficult.
    - Create mechanisms for users to do the heavy lifting.
    - Attract like-minded individuals.
    - People with similar problems often have similar needs.
    - Design retention tactics.

### Example: Netflix
- Allowing account sharing can lock in users as multiple people rely on the product (e.g., Amazon, Netflix).
- Once sufficient value is established, you can phase out multiple accounts.

### Tactical Examples
- **Awareness**: Discounts, scarcity, rarity, convenience, problem-solving ability.
- **Actions**: Proof of concept measures, relevant metrics, product-market fit.
    - Willingness to pay indicates market fit.
    - If not, identify the reasons.
- **Attract Others**: 
    - Do not raise money until market fit is achieved.
    - Avoid scaling volume until market fit is confirmed.
    - If the perfect customer is unwilling to pay, reconsider further investment.
    - Market fit is indicated by higher demand than production capacity.

### Acquisition and Growth Strategy
- Identify three adjacent models/competitors.
    - Analyze their acquisition and onboarding processes.
    - Document the steps and describe any friction points.
- Understand and document their growth loop processes.
- Design your onboarding process.
- Identify and document effective growth strategies from competitors.
    - Address and mitigate friction points.

### Cohort KPIs
- Define a cohort of customers to use as a test group.
- Track customer interactions, noting where they drop off or succeed.
