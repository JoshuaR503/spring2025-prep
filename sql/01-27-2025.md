## CLASS GOALS:
- Design a database
- Understand the importance of databases over linear data storage
- Learn about SQL and NoSQL
- Explore database design considerations

## Why Use a Database
- Effective and better way to manage data
- DBMS are tools to create, manage, and interact with databases
- MS SQL Server is tough to use

## Dangers of NoSQL
- Data loss if the system crashes during data transfer
- NoSQL can't implement atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
- Atomicity means all or nothing

## Cool Stuff About SQL
- Flexible schema requirements
- Good for distributed systems

> It's not about what you know, it's about what the application needs

## Levels Of Abstraction
### PHYSICAL:
- Primary and foreign keys, the most critical content

### LOGICAL:
- Design schemas and change them later

### VIEW:
- Code about the architecture

## Database Engine
- Storage Manager
- Query Preprocessing
- Transaction Manager

## INNO
- Most popular?

## Modeling

| CLASS     | ENROLL      | STUDENT   |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
|           |             |           |

- "A class shall have at least one student"
- "A student shall enroll in at least one class"

### Entities and Attributes
- SQUARE means an entity, an abstract object with properties
- Attributes are properties of an entity
- Multivalue attributes exist

## RELATIONAL MODEL
- ID
- Name
- Dept ID

- Every entity corresponds to a table
- Every row is an entity

## DEGREE OF TABLE
- Number of properties or attributes (columns)
- Important for query creation
- Cardinality: Number of unique entities in the table

## Business Requirements and Database Requirements

## Null vs Empty
- Null: Does not exist
- Empty: Exists but has no value
- Null does not count as cardinality unless the primary key is not null
- Primary key must have a value and must not be repeated
- Databases are implemented as linked lists, every table has a pointer
- Memory in databases is dynamic
- NULL is not a pointer but still uses a value

## Fields Authentication
- Avoid letting users enter raw data to maintain normalization

## DDL: Data Definition Language
- Code to create/alter tables
- Dropping tables wipes out everything, know the creation order

## DML: Data Manipulation Language
- Important for understanding the degree of the table

## DQL: Data Query Language
- Learn about selecting, joins, group by, having, where
- Order of query execution
- Optimize queries

## DCL: Data Control Language
- Manage permissions and control access
- Avoid SQL injections

## Indexing and DB Organization
- Focus on the why, not the how, when writing queries
- Optimize queries for efficiency
- Small data uses linear fashion, large data uses indexes
- B+ Tree: Search O(log base f n)

### Example:
- Log base 2 16 = 4 comparisons
- Log base 4 16 = 2 comparisons

- Increase pointers horizontally to reduce complexity
- Indexing and DB organization: Root, split node, copy up smallest value
- Use extensible hashes for time complexity

## Transaction Management and Concurrency Control
- Hamiltonian Path
- Traveling Salesman
- Implement own DBMS for more control over data

## Distributed and Parallel Databases
- Types of parallelism: Partition and pipelining
- Database replication: Optimize and create copies on different servers
- One server writes, others read
- Every microservice has an ID
