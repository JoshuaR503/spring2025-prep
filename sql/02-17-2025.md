# Database Normalization

Normalization is a process that decreases redundancy in your tables and increases the integrity of your database. However, applying excessive normalization can decrease the performance of your database.

## 7 Normal Forms

Every time you add a normal form, all tables must adhere to the same normal form. It is also important to study indexing and transaction management.

### First Normal Form (1NF)

To meet the first normal form, a table must satisfy the following conditions:
* All values in the table must be atomic (smallest possible unit, e.g., strings, numbers).
* All values in the same column must adhere to the same datatype.
* No repeated groups in columns from the same table.
* All non-key attributes in a table must refer to a primary key (every table needs a primary key).

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

To meet the second normal form, a table must satisfy the following conditions:
* Must meet 1NF.
* Non-key attributes can't have partial dependencies on the primary key.

Partial dependencies occur when a non-key attribute is dependent on only a part of a composite primary key. In order to pass 2NF, values must be related to both parts of a composite primary key.

#### Example of 2NF

Consider a table `Orders` with the following columns:
- `OrderID` (Primary Key)
- `ProductID` (Primary Key)
- `ProductName`
- `Quantity`

To satisfy 2NF, `ProductName` should not be in this table because it only depends on `ProductID`, not on the combination of `OrderID` and `ProductID`. Instead, `ProductName` should be moved to a separate `Products` table.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

To meet the third normal form, a table must satisfy the following conditions:
* Must meet 2NF.
* No transitive dependencies in non-key attributes.

Transitive dependencies occur when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute. To achieve 3NF, all non-key attributes must be directly dependent on the primary key. Normalization is about known attributes. if you do not know your database, it is difficult to apply normalization.

#### Example of 3NF

Consider a table `CheckIn` with the following columns:
- `CheckInID` (Primary Key)
- `PassengerID`
- `PassengerName`
- `FlightCode`
- `SeatsReserved`
- `Departure`
- `Arrival`

To satisfy 3NF:
- `PassengerName` should be moved to a separate `Passengers` table, as it only depends on `PassengerID`.
- `FlightCode` should be a foreign key referencing the `Flights` table.
- `SeatsReserved` belongs in the `CheckIn` table as it is directly related to the check-in process.
- `Departure` and `Arrival` should be foreign keys in the `Flights` table, not in the `CheckIn` table.

By organizing the tables this way, we ensure that all non-key attributes are directly dependent on the primary key, eliminating transitive dependencies and adhering to 3NF.

### Example of 3NF with Multiple Tables

Consider the following tables:

**Customer**
- `CustomerID` (Primary Key)
- `CustomerName`
- `Address`

**Order**
- `OrderID` (Primary Key)
- `CustomerID` (Foreign Key)
- `ProductID` (Foreign Key)
- `SupplierID` (Foreign Key)

**Product**
- `ProductID` (Primary Key)
- `ProductName`

**Supplier**
- `SupplierID` (Primary Key)
- `SupplierName`

In this example:
- A customer can have one or many suppliers.
- The `Order` table links customers, products, and suppliers through foreign keys.
- Each table is organized to ensure that all non-key attributes are directly dependent on the primary key, adhering to 3NF.

By following these principles, you can design a database that minimizes redundancy and maintains data integrity.



## Notes
Optimizations and normalizations are different things. For mid term 1, no normalization is needed.
no need to show, only explain 
optimizations will be required in the final exam 


joining tables decreases the performance
you need to consider if you need to make more tables
